        <p><strong>Audis</strong> Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>
        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>Audis is an iOS app that helps you rediscover albums from your Apple
            Music library that were added on the same day in previous years. This
            privacy policy explains what data the app accesses, how it is used, and
            how it is stored.</p>
        <h2 id="data-we-access">Data We Access</h2>
        <h3 id="apple-music-library">Apple Music Library</h3>
        <p>The app requests access to your Apple Music library through Apple’s
            MusicKit framework. This access is used solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read which albums are in your library and when they were added</li>
            <li>Display album artwork, titles, artist names, and track listings</li>
            <li>Show listening statistics (play counts, last played dates)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your Apple Music library data is never transmitted to any external
            server. It is only used locally on your device to display your “on this
            day” albums.</p>
        <h3 id="location-data">Location Data</h3>
        <p>The app may request access to your location for the Map feature.
            Location access is used solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Center the map on your current position when viewing location-tagged
                albums</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Location access is optional and the app functions fully without it.
            The app never tracks or records your device location.</p>
        <p>You may also manually assign geographic locations to albums using the
            location picker. These user-assigned album locations are stored as
            coordinates in your iCloud account (see Data Storage below).</p>
        <h2 id="data-we-store">Data We Store</h2>
        <h3 id="local-cache">Local Cache</h3>
        <p>The app maintains a local cache of album identifiers and their added
            dates on your device. This cache is used to quickly filter albums by
            date without needing to re-query your full library each time. This data
            stays on your device and is not synced to any cloud service.</p>
        <h3 id="icloud-sync-cloudkit">iCloud Sync (CloudKit)</h3>
        <p>The app stores the following user-created data in your personal
            iCloud account via Apple’s CloudKit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Album notes</strong>: Text notes you write about albums</li>
            <li><strong>Album locations</strong>: Geographic coordinates you assign
                to albums via the location picker</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is synced across your Apple devices signed into the same
            iCloud account. It is stored in your private CloudKit database, meaning
            only you can access it. The developer has no access to your CloudKit
            data.</p>
        <h3 id="user-preferences">User Preferences</h3>
        <p>The app stores minimal preferences locally on your device (e.g.,
            appearance setting, last refresh timestamp) using standard iOS storage.
            These are not synced or transmitted.</p>
        <h2 id="data-we-do-not-collect">Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal
                information</li>
            <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> use any analytics or tracking
                frameworks</li>
            <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> contain any advertising</li>
            <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> transmit any data to the developer
                or any third party</li>
            <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> create user accounts or require
                sign-in (beyond your existing iCloud account for sync)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="third-party-services">Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app uses only first-party Apple frameworks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MusicKit</strong> for Apple Music library access</li>
            <li><strong>CloudKit</strong> for iCloud data sync</li>
            <li><strong>MapKit</strong> for map display and place search</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No third-party SDKs, analytics tools, or advertising networks are
            included in the app.</p>
        <h2 id="data-retention-and-deletion">Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local cache</strong>: Cleared automatically when you delete
                the app</li>
            <li><strong>iCloud data (notes and locations)</strong>: Stored in your
                iCloud account. You can delete individual notes and locations within the
                app. All app data is removed from iCloud when you delete the app,
                subject to Apple’s standard iCloud data retention policies</li>
            <li><strong>User preferences</strong>: Cleared when you delete the
                app</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="childrens-privacy">Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The app does not knowingly collect any personal information from
            children. The app does not collect personal information from any
            user.</p>
        <h2 id="changes-to-this-policy">Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected in
            the “Last updated” date above.</p>
